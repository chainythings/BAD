							<p><b>Artist</b>
							<p><em>We first recognized ilan while browsing KnownOrigin.io. His artworks are very different from what is sytlistic ruling these days. Incentive enough for us to invite ilan to give some insights into his work and activites on the blockchain!</em></p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<img src="images/PEOPLE_003-Ilan-Katin.jpg" alt="B.A.D's PEOPLE PORTRAIT" style="height: auto; width: 250px"><br>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><b>What is the name by which blockchainart and cryptocollectibles community knows you?</b><br>
							ilan Katin</p>
							<p><b>What is your professional background and career?</b><br>
							I studied art and have worked in a lot of different areas related to computer graphics.</p>
							<p><b>Please give a short statement about yourself, your work, your art, your aesthetics, your vision, and everything else you want people to know about you as a person active in the blockchainart and cryptocollectibles space.</b><br>
							I create art work on a daily basis. The material from this ritual of creation allows for a thick and rich compost of ideas and concepts that emerge in the process of assembling the materials together. The common thread of my work throughout the years has been to capture and transform the essence of my  drawings. Being able to put some of this work on the blockchain has exposed this work to a new audience and somewhat flowed back to the ideas that I am working with.</p>
							<p><b>Which is your medium?</b><br>
							Acrylic on paper or wood.</p>
							<p><b>How would you describe your art?</b><br>
							My work is mostly non-objective, non-figurative or abstract. I have been in that 'space' for a long time now, although I do some sticker designs for dissemenating what I consider to be positive incantations.</p>
							<p><b>Which artworks, artists and styles do you admire the most, and which shaped you the most?</b><br>
							It's hard to say exactly. But usually music as the strongest influence on me.</p>

							<a href="https://superrare.co/artwork/niche-2433" target="_blank">https://superrare.co/artwork/niche-2433</a></p>
							<p><b>What lead you to the blockchain?</b><br>
							A combination of curiosity and commerce.</p>
							<p><b>Since when are you active in the crypto space?</b><br>
							Must have been November 2018.</p>
							<p><b>What is your contribution to the blockchainart, cryptocollectibles and NFT field?</b><br>
							For the moment I think of myself as an 'end user'. But I can expand on that somewhat. I have been through several 'tech trends'. Blockchain to me seems like another one. As long as there are human beings there will be art. I am not 100% sure (nor is anybody for that matter) that blockchain will outlive art. Perhaps that's obvious. Sometimes I get the impression that it is not so I am taking the liberty of stating that here. But stating this is not to belittle the impact that this technology has had for some of us who have jumped in early, although I have to say that I consider myself a latecomer. For me the experience of 'putting art on the blockchain' has had three positive effects: a) I have been able earn some money that allows me to cover some basic necessities, which leads to b) That I am working a bit harder to develop my work in a way that I always wanted to and c) probably more importantly and oft overlooked is that I have met some like minded people. I can't tell you how much a value this small group of people even though I have never met them face to face. I guess I am contributing to the movement by being a part of it in this way.</p>
							<p><b>Which tools do you use to create your blockchainart?</b><br>
							Dada.NYC, Photoshop, Procreate, Cinema4D, Blender and After Effects.</p>
							<p><b>By using which tools do you tokenize your artworks?</b><br>
							I tokenize on SuperRare, KnownOrigin, MakersPlace and contribute to Dada.NYC</p>
							<p><b>Further info you'd like to provide re the creation process?</b><br>
							The less I think before and while I am doing something the more easily the work emerges.</p>

							<h3>Cynthia Gayton</h3>
							<p><b>Founder of Gayton Law</b><br><a href="http://www.gayton-law.com/" target="_blank">http://www.gayton-law.com/</a></p>
							<p><em>It was at the pre-party of #RareAF in January 2018, when we met Cynthia. She was introduced to us as 'lawyer who had an art gallery and hosts a crypto art podcast together with DJ J Scrilla'. Since then, Cynthia has accompanied us on our way through blockchain land.</em></p>

							<p><b>What is the name by which blockchainart and cryptocollectibles community knows you?</b><br>
							Cynthia Gayton</p>
							<p><b>Which company are you representing?</b><br>
							Gayton Law</p>
							<p><b>What is your professional background and career?</b><br>
							Attorney and educator</p>
							<p><b>Please give a short statement about yourself, your work, your art, your aesthetics, your vision, and everything else you want people to know about you as a person active in the blockchainart and cryptocollectibles space.</b><br>
							I have been working with artists and technologists for most of my professional career. Blockchain art is evolving and is several stages beyond when I first got into it. I think that so long as artists and developers (and even lawyers!) work together, some practical solutions to ongoing problems in the art world will be realized. That is a vision of mine - increased legal transaction transparency and reducing transaction risk.</p>
							<p><b>Which is your medium?</b><br>
							Collage, oil</p>
							<p><b>How would you describe your art?</b><br>
							Hmm. I like colors. I also like texture. I like tangible versus intangible. Eclectic is probably the right word.</p>
							<p><b>Which artworks, artists and styles do you admire the most, and which shaped you the most?</b><br>
							There are too many to list here, but for overall artistic professionalism, crypto knowledge depth, and sincere interest, I would have to say cryptograffiti, Rob Myers, Joe Chiappeta and Nanu Berks come to mind as unique contributors. Bea Ramos and Judy Mam helped shape how I think about artistic collaboration and about ethics in art.</p>

							<p><b>What lead you to the blockchain?</b><br>
							Learning about smart contracts!</p>
							<p><b>Since when are you active in the crypto space?</b><br>
							I have been involved most heavily on the crypto space since late 2016. I became interested in bitcoin as an alternative to credit cards when I had my art gallery - 2011-2014.</p>
							<p><b>What is your contribution to the blockchainart, cryptocollectibles and NFT field?</b><br>
							I have had seminars, meet-ups, articles, legal and consulting services in these related fields. I co-hosted a podcast as well as an FM radio show with J Scrilla, dedicated exclusively to crypto art and crypto music until earlier this year - 2019. I have sold my own physical art and have shown one piece at an art show for lawyers. This is the first year that I have offered for sale a crypto art piece.</p>
							<p><b>Anything else you want the community to know?</b><br>
							Participate, get involved, shape your future. </p>

							<h3>Judy Mam</h3>
							<p><b>Co-founder of DADA</b><br><a href="https://dada.nyc" target="_blank">https://dada.nyc</a></p>
							<p><em>Some of the first purchases on the dada.nyc platform in 2018 and a tweet about it lead us to Judy Mam and Beatriz Ramos - two exceptional personalities with a lot of commitment and passion for their project. We have met several times since then and hope to add many more meetings in the future.</em></p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<img src="images/PEOPLE_001-Judy-Mam.jpg" alt="B.A.D's PEOPLE PORTRAIT" style="height: auto; width: 250px"><br>

							<p><b>What is the name by which blockchainart and cryptocollectibles community knows you?</b><br>
							Judy Mam</p>
							<p><b>Which company are you representing?</b><br>
							DADA</p>
							<p><b>What is your professional background and career?</b><br>
							I am a writer and used to be a creative director in advertising.</p>
							<p><b>What lead you to the blockchain?</b><br>
							My company, DADA, a social network where people communicate through drawings creating visual conversations which we tokenize on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
							<p><b>Please give a short statement about yourself, your work, your art, your aesthetics, your vision, and everything else you want people to know about you as a person active in the blockchainart and cryptocollectibles space.</b><br>
							I'm proud that I can honestly say that with DADA we are doing something that impacts the lives of people in wonderful ways, and that we have created a work of art that involves a global community of artists. I believe art is a human instinct, a human need, and essential to human progress and civilization. Society does not consider it a priority, but art should be an integral part of people's daily lives. Everybody should make art, and everybody should be able to collect art.Technology, and blockchain in particular, offers revolutionary ways by which this can happen. What excites me is precisely that blockchain allows us to broaden our usual mindset and explore ways to be more collaborative and more fair, and find unorthodox but effective solutions for artists.</p>
							<p><b>Which artworks, artists and styles do you admire the most, and which shaped you the most?</b><br>
							I grew up in a house where art was appreciated. My parents took us to museums from an early age and they were modest art collectors. My dad was an advisor to collectors. So even though I'm not an artist, I have been around art for as long as I can remember. I like lots of art, from the Renaissance to mostly modern art. I love too many artists to count here. I don't like the artists-marketers like Banksy or Jeff Koons.</p>
