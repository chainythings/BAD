								<h3>It's all about the blockart people.</h3>

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>B.A.D hosts - on a not very regular basis and most randomly - short portraits of people active in the blockchainart, cryptocollectibles and NFT field. We invite artists, CEOs, hackers, creatives, collectors and other unicorns to provide some info about theirselves and their work, and let the community know about their relation to blockchain and art. Enjoy exlusive insights into some of the core people's work.</p>

							<p><b>Co-founder of DADA</b><br><a href="https://dada.nyc" target="_blank">https://dada.nyc</a></p>
							<p><em>Some of the first purchases on the dada.nyc platform in 2018 and a tweet about it lead us to Judy Mam and Beatriz Ramos - two exceptional personalities with a lot of commitment and passion for their project. We have met several times since then and hope to add many more meetings in the future.</em></p>

							<p><b>What is the name by which blockchainart and cryptocollectibles community knows you?</b><br>
							Judy Mam</p>
							<p><b>Which company are you representing?</b><br>
							DADA</p>
							<p><b>What is your professional background and career?</b><br>
							I am a writer and used to be a creative director in advertising.</p>
							<p><b>What lead you to the blockchain?</b><br>
							My company, DADA, a social network where people communicate through drawings creating visual conversations which we tokenize on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
							<p><b>Please give a short statement about yourself, your work, your art, your aesthetics, your vision, and everything else you want people to know about you as a person active in the blockchainart and cryptocollectibles space.</b><br>
							I'm proud that I can honestly say that with DADA we are doing something that impacts the lives of people in wonderful ways, and that we have created a work of art that involves a global community of artists. I believe art is a human instinct, a human need, and essential to human progress and civilization. Society does not consider it a priority, but art should be an integral part of people's daily lives. Everybody should make art, and everybody should be able to collect art.Technology, and blockchain in particular, offers revolutionary ways by which this can happen. What excites me is precisely that blockchain allows us to broaden our usual mindset and explore ways to be more collaborative and more fair, and find unorthodox but effective solutions for artists.</p>
							<p><b>Which artworks, artists and styles do you admire the most, and which shaped you the most?</b><br>
							I grew up in a house where art was appreciated. My parents took us to museums from an early age and they were modest art collectors. My dad was an advisor to collectors. So even though I'm not an artist, I have been around art for as long as I can remember. I like lots of art, from the Renaissance to mostly modern art. I love too many artists to count here. I don't like the artists-marketers like Banksy or Jeff Koons.</p>
