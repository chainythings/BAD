								<h1>About B.A.D</h1>
								<p>some background info for your convenience</p>
							</header>
							
							<p>Art stored on and distributed via blockchains is a relatively new, but immersively emerging issue. The success of the first public meeting in this area - the Rare Art Festival, which took place in January 2018 in New York City - as well as follow up events organised by small and big key players in the new and traditional art and curation market is expression of this development. The reason why artists, consumers, curators and collectors value the opportunities that are offered by this new way of distribution is rooted in the technological possibilities that meet the needs of artist on the one and the expectations of consumers on the other hand: smart contracts can ensure that art is distributed from the artist to the consumer, without middlemen (or at least a minimum of service charge), rewarding the artist for their work, and certifying originality, origin and ownership of the artwork to the buyer.</p>
							<h2>What?</h2>
							<p>With B.A.D, we introduce a web community fed directory that serves as a service featuring a comprehensive collection of current, future and former projects which are dedicated to blockchain art and crypto collectibles. B.A.D. covers visual, auditive and multimedia blockchain art and is open to contents from individuals and institutions active in the field. Information about events, art works, technological developments and further information will contribute to an overview on a wide range of activities related to this ever emerging topic.</p>
							<h2>Why?</h2>
							<p>As the field of blockchain art is relatively new, but the demand is quickly emerging the directory will serve as a useful tool for art makers, curators and consumers to gain visibility and connect through B.A.D.</p>
							<h2>How?</h2>
							<p>B.A.D is a free-to-use service. If you would like to see your information added to the data base, please contact us at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/BchainArtDir" target="_blank">twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:BchainArtDir@protonmail.com">e-mail</a>.</p>
