							<h3>Get familiar with essentials for becoming a blockchainart and cryptocollectibles artist or collector</h3>

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<p>Blockchainart and cryptocollectibles are maybe the most impactful incentives to engage with crypto currencies and blockchain technology. But for end-users who don't have a deep understanding of the technology behind these structures it might be hard to get involved. We at B.A.D want to make the entry into the blockchain world a bit easier for you. We hope that the following resources are useful to get an initial understanding on how to get some coins, how to maintain a wallet, where to buy crypto art, and where to sell your NFTs.</p>
							
							<span class="starred">Please note: This is not advice. What you can read here is basing on our own experiences and worked for us. If you are not sure how to get active in the space, we strongly suggest that you inform yourself properly on other resources! You are responsible for your actions, not us.</span>

							<h3>I want to get myself some cryptos. What do I have to do?</h3>
							<p>Cryptocurrencies are sold and traded on exchanges. Whilst some exchanges require the possession of cryptocurrencies in order to trade them for other crypto currencies, there are exchanges where customers can buy cryptocurrencies with fiat money. When you are reading this introduction, it is most likely that you don't own cryptos, but want to purchase some. In this case, it is highly recommended that you inform yourself in advance and taht you act very carefully when getting active in the crypto market. For example, check if you are eligible to buy on certain exchanges (e.g. because of you age or your residency or your liquid funds). Also, it is essential that you undertake some research in advance to make sure that the platform you intend to buy cryptos on is not a scam website and thus a risk for your money and / or your identity to be stolen.</p>
							
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>I did my homework and am sure that I acquired the knowledge to buy some cryptos. But how can I be sure not to be taken by scammers?</h3>
							<p>You never ever can. The risk of becoming victim of scammers is particularly high in the blockchain and crypto contexte, even for experienced users. For example, it might appear that hackers capture a website, or clone it and link to it with domain names very similar to the original, or they place different kinds of malware on websites, or they ask you for your private key or seed phrase, etc.</p> If you want a quite comprehensive list of warnings, have a look at Harry's tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/sniko_/status/1064533135457546240" target="_blank">how to test your own security</a>, and <a href="https://mycrypto.com" target="_blank">MyCropto's</a> <a href="https://support.mycrypto.com/security/securing-your-ethereum.html" target="_blank">security do's and dont's</a>.
							If you want certainty while browsing, consider to install browser extensions which check the websites you browse for malware. If you use Google and browse Ethereum websites with Chrome: <a href="https://mycrypto.com" target="_blank">MyCropto</a> recommends to install <a href="https://harrydenley.com/ethaddresslookup-chrome-extension-release/" target="_blank">EAL</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige" target="_blank">Cryptonite by Metacert</a> to warn you when you happen to accidentially browse malicious websites.</p>

							<h3>I know now where to buy cryptos. But as they are "virtual money", where can I store them?</h3>
							<p>Cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets. Wallets are comparable with physical wallets, or bank accounts, but crypto wallets are usually accessible for you only, and are super secure as long as you follow some basic rules (e.g. always triple-safe your seed phrase when first installing a wallet, and never ever share your private key). Thus, before owning crypto currencies, blockchain art, crypto collectibles or comparable assets, you need to get hold of a wallet and an address. The current NFT market has a strong focus on Ethereum and Bitcoin based technologies, so you might want to watch out for one of these two or even both before you start. Once you bougth cryptos, you should transfer them from the exchange to your wallet (of which you own and triple-saved the seed phrase), which contains an address (of which you own and triple-safed the private key) to which you send your cryptos.</p>
						
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
								
							<h3>What the heck is going on? This is so complicated!</h3>
							<p>Yes, right, it is not easy. But once you reached this point, you really achieved a lot already. You are still an early adopter, and this is the price you have to pay to be among the first. Keep going.</p>
							
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>I bought crypto coins on an exchange, installed a wallet and have an address. But how to get this together now?</h3>
							<p>You should avoid to store your assets (crypto currencies as well as crypto art and other NFTs) on exchanges, and you should avoid to buy crypto art directly through the exchange you bought your cryptos at. Usually, once you bought crypto coins on an exchange, you send it to an address in your wallet. Why so cpmplicated, you might ask? This is because you usually don't own the private key of your exchange address, which puts your assets potentially at risk. Also, the exchange address might not be related to your assets and funds only, but be shared with other exchange users. Thus it might happen that your digital art simply disappears in the nirvana of third-party accounts when you buy it through an exchange address or send it to an exchange address. Or it might happen that an exchanges closes down, and with it disappears your address and all your funds on it because you unfortunately don't hold the private key of your address. Sorry for you then, because your stuff will be lost then. Irreversible and Forever.

							<h3>I own crypto currencies and put them into my wallet. Where can I buy blockchainart and cryptocollectibles?</h3>
							<p>If you are looking for a crypto art marketplace, you can have a look into the B.A.D data base. Head over to the <a href="../../BAD-master_ab_2019-04-18/BAD-master/bad.html" target="_blank">B.A.D data base</a> and filter for "sales platform" and/or "marketplaces". The collection you will see listed is most likely not comprehensive, but should provide a good overview for people new in the field. And even though platforms and marketplaces are different, the procedure when buying items with cryto currencies is very similar. Most pages provide instructions on how to interact with their service.</p>
						
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
									
							<h3>Now that I own digital blockchain art: Where is it and where can I see it?</h3>
							<p>The digital art you bought by using blockchain technology is (irreversibly) tied up with you wallet address. But this doesn't mean that you automatically see your art when you access your wallet. Most platforms, if not all, provide a galery in which the assets you bought with them are listed. So you can access the sales platform and market place every time you want to see your digital art. Also, you can connect your address with a dApp (decentralised application) with a gallery function. That's basically it. Have a look at our <a href="edu_BasicsPlatforms.html">"ONBOARDING: BLOCKCHAINART PLATFORMS & MARKET PLACES"</a> section. The list might contain links to dApps that might be of use for you.</p>
						
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>I am an artist and want to make my art available via blockchain technology. What do I have to do?</h3>
							<p>Basically, you have to start with the steps described above: Get yourself a wallet, an address, some coins, and also a software whith which you can watch the art you produced. But you need to do this 'putting the art on the blockchain' thing (we call it 'tokenizing'). That's what distinguishes you from the broad mass of collectors. To toeknize your art, some nice people developed very good tools to make this step easy for you - even if you are not a programmer. Maybe you want to have a look at our <a href="edu_BasicsPlatforms.html">"ONBOARDING: BLOCKCHAINART PLATFORMS & MARKET PLACES"</a>. You might want to watch out for what contains "Tokenizing" in the headline, and what is labelled "All-in-one solutions". The different platforms provide comprehensive instructions about what to do to tokenize your art work.</p>
							
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>I want to sell some pieces of art I once collected. Where can I do this?</h3>
							<p>There are several options available to re-sell art. Some sales platforms might offer the opportunity to sell art you bought directly through this platform. Some don't, so you have to check market places and see if they would sell your asset. And again, B.A.D had a look for you and is happy to provide you with some links to market places. Please go to our <a href="edu_BasicsPlatforms.html">"ONBOARDING: BLOCKCHAINART PLATFORMS & MARKET PLACES"</a> section. The list might contain links to market places that might be of interest to you.</p>
