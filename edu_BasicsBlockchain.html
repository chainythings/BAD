							<h3>Get familiar with essentials for becoming a blockchainart and cryptocollectibles artist or collector</h3>

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<p>Blockchainart and cryptocollectibles are maybe the most impactful incentives to engage with crypto currencies and blockchain technology. But for end-users without a deep understanding of the technology behind these structures, it might be hard to get involved. We at B.A.D want to make the entry into the blockchain world a bit easier for you. We believe that the following resources are useful to get an initial understanding on how to get some coins, how to maintain a wallet, where to buy crypto art, and where to sell it.</p>
							
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr style="border-style: dotted;" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>I want to get myself some cryptos. What do I have to do?</h3>
							<p>Cryptocurrencies are sold and traded on exchanges. Whilst some exchanges require the possession of cryptocurrencies in order to trade them for other crypto currencies, there are exchanges where customers can buy cryptocurrencies with fiat money. When you are reading this introduction, it is most likely that you don't own cryptos, but want to purchase some. In this case, it is highly recommended that you inform yourself in advance and are very careful when getting active in the crypto market. For example, check if you are eligible to buy on certain exchanges (e.g. because of you age or your residency or your liquid funds). Also, it is essential that you undertake some research to make sure that the platform you intend to buy cryptos on is not a scam website and thus a risky for your money and / or your identity to be stolen.</p>
							
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>I know now where to buy cryptos. But as they are "virtual money", where can I store them?</h3>
							<p>Cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets. Wallets are comparable with physical wallets, or bank accounts, but crypto wallets are usually accessible for you only, and are super secure as long as you follow some rules (e.g. always triple-safe your seed phrase when first installing a wallet, and never ever share your private key). Before owning crypto currencies, blockchain art, crypto collectibles or comparable assets, you need to get hold of a wallet and an address. The current NFT market has a strong focus on Ethereum and Bitcoin based technologies, so you might want to watch out for one of these two or even both before you start. You'd say: 'Hey, I bought cryptos on an exchange, I own an address already!' We say: 'Nope. Please do never ever store your assets on exchanges.' Why? You usually don't own the private key of your exchange address which puts your assets potentially at risk. Also, the exchange address might not be related to your assets and funds only, but be shared with other exchange users. So it might happen that your digital art simply disappears in the nirvana of third-party accounts when you sent it to an exchange address. So where to store your stuff then? Every address can hold the info about your asset. So if you have i.e. an Ethereum address in MetaMask, you can send your crypto  art to it. That's basically it. But if you want to watch it, you need to tie your account to a decentralised software  (a so-called dApp) which allows you to display your art like in a gallery. A list of such dApps can be found in <a href="edu_BasicsPlatforms.html">"ONBOARDING: BLOCKCHAINART PLATFORMS &amp; MARKET PLACES"</a> section.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>I did my homework and am sure that I acquired the knowledge to buy some cryptos. But how can I be sure not to be taken by scammers?</h3>
							<p>You never ever can. The risk of becoming victim of scammers is particularly high in the blockchain and crypto contexte. Even for experienced users. For example, it might appear that hackers capture a website, or clone it and link to it with domain names very similar to the original, or they place different kinds of malware on websites, etc.</p>
If you want a quite comprehensive list of warnings, have a look at Harry's tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/sniko_/status/1064533135457546240" target="_blank">how to test your own security</a>, and <a href="https://mycrypto.com" target="_blank">MyCropto's</a> <a href="https://support.mycrypto.com/security/securing-your-ethereum.html" target="_blank">security doe's and dont's</a>.
							If you want certainty while browsing, consider to install browser extensions which check the websites you browse for malware. If you use Google and browse Ethereum website with Chrome, <a href="https://mycrypto.com" target="_blank">MyCropto</a> recommends to install <a href="https://harrydenley.com/ethaddresslookup-chrome-extension-release/" target="_blank">EAL</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige" target="_blank">Cryptonite by Metacert</a> to warn you when browsing malicious websites.

							<h3>I own crypto currencies. Where can I buy blockchainart and cryptocollectibles</h3>
							<p>A list of market places is available on B.A.D. Even though platforms and marketplaces are different, the procedure when buying items with cryto currencies is very similar. Head over to the B.A.D data base and search for "marketplaces". The collection is most likely not comprehensive, but should provide a good overview for people new in the filed.</p>
							
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>Now that I own digital blockchain art: Where is it and where can I see it?</h3>
							<p>The digital art you bought by using blockchain technology is irreversibly tight up with you wallet address. So when you want to access your art, you first of all have to access your wallet address. Second, it makes sense to connect your address with a dApp with a gallery function. Also here, we have some links for you. Have a look at our <a href="edu_BasicsPlatforms.html">"ONBOARDING: BLOCKCHAINART PLATFORMS & MARKET PLACES"</a> section. The list should contain links to dApps that might be of use for you.</p>
							
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>I am an artist and want to make my art available via blockchain technology. What do I have to do?</h3>
							<p>Basically, you have to start with the steps described above: Get yourself a wallet address, some coins, and also a software whith which you can watch the art you produced. But you need to do this 'putting the art on the blockchain' thing. For this, some nice people developed very good tools to make this step easy for you even if you are not a programmer. We'd suggest that you have a look at our <a href="edu_BasicsPlatforms.html">"ONBOARDING: BLOCKCHAINART PLATFORMS & MARKET PLACES"</a>. You might need what contains "Tokenizing" in the headline, and what is labelled "All-in-one solutions". The different platforms provide comprehensive instructions about what to do to tokenize your art work.</p>
							
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>I want to sell some pieces of art I once collected. Where can I do this?</h3>
							<p>There are several options available to re-sell art. Some sales platforms might offer the opportunity to sell art you bought directly through this platform. Some don't, so you have to check market places and see if they would sell your asset. And again, B.A.D had a look for you and is happy to provide you with some links to market places. Please go to our <a href="edu_BasicsPlatforms.html">"ONBOARDING: BLOCKCHAINART PLATFORMS & MARKET PLACES"</a> section. The list should contain links to market places that might be of interest to you.</p>
