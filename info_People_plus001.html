							<h3>Cynthia Gayton</h3>
							<p><b>Founder of Gayton Law</b><br><a href="http://www.gayton-law.com/" target="_blank">http://www.gayton-law.com/</a></p>
							<p><em>It was at the pre-party of #RareAF in January 2018, when we met Cynthia. She was introduced to us as 'lawyer who had an art gallery and hosts a crypto art podcast together with DJ J Scrilla'. Since then, Cynthia has accompanied us on our way through blockchain land.</em></p>

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p><b>What is the name by which blockchainart and cryptocollectibles community knows you?</b><br>
							Cynthia Gayton</p>
							<p><b>Which company are you representing?</b><br>
							Gayton Law</p>
							<p><b>What is your professional background and career?</b><br>
							Attorney and educator</p>
							<p><b>Please give a short statement about yourself, your work, your art, your aesthetics, your vision, and everything else you want people to know about you as a person active in the blockchainart and cryptocollectibles space.</b><br>
							I have been working with artists and technologists for most of my professional career. Blockchain art is evolving and is several stages beyond when I first got into it. I think that so long as artists and developers (and even lawyers!) work together, some practical solutions to ongoing problems in the art world will be realized. That is a vision of mine - increased legal transaction transparency and reducing transaction risk.</p>
							<p><b>Which is your medium?</b><br>
							Collage, oil</p>
							<p><b>How would you describe your art?</b><br>
							Hmm. I like colors. I also like texture. I like tangible versus intangible. Eclectic is probably the right word.</p>
							<p><b>Which artworks, artists and styles do you admire the most, and which shaped you the most?</b><br>
							There are too many to list here, but for overall artistic and professional  depth, I would have to say cryptograffiti.</p>
							<p><b>One of your recent artworks</b><br>
							<a href="https://steemit.com/artificial/@squizzi/parabola" target="_blank">https://steemit.com/artificial/@squizzi/parabola</a></p>
							<p><b>What lead you to the blockchain?</b><br>
							Learning about smart contracts!</p>
							<p><b>Since when are you active in the crypto space?</b><br>
							I have been involved most heavily on the crypto space since late 2016 while I became interested in bitcoin as an alternative to credit cards when I had my art gallery - 2011-2014.</p>
							<p><b>What is your contribution to the blockchainart, cryptocollectibles and NFT field?</b><br>
							I have had seminars, meet-ups, articles, legal and consulting services in these related fields. I co-hosted a podcast as well as an FM radio show with J Scrilla, dedicated exclusively to crypto art and crypto music until earlier this year - 2019. I have sold my own physical art and have shown one piece at an art show for lawyers. This is the first year that I have offered for sale a crypto art piece.</p>
							<p><b>Anything else you want the community to know?</b><br>
							Participate, get involved, shape your future. </p>

							<h3>Judy Mam</h3>
							<p><b>Co-founder of DADA</b><br><a href="https://dada.nyc" target="_blank">https://dada.nyc</a></p>
							<p><em>Some of the first purchases on the dada.nyc platform in 2018 and a tweet about it lead us to Judy Mam and Beatriz Ramos - two exceptional personalities with a lot of commitment and passion for their project. We have met several times since then and hope to add many more meetings in the future.</em></p>

							<p><b>What is the name by which blockchainart and cryptocollectibles community knows you?</b><br>
							Judy Mam</p>
							<p><b>Which company are you representing?</b><br>
							DADA</p>
							<p><b>What is your professional background and career?</b><br>
							I am a writer and used to be a creative director in advertising.</p>
							<p><b>What lead you to the blockchain?</b><br>
							My company, DADA, a social network where people communicate through drawings creating visual conversations which we tokenize on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
							<p><b>Please give a short statement about yourself, your work, your art, your aesthetics, your vision, and everything else you want people to know about you as a person active in the blockchainart and cryptocollectibles space.</b><br>
							I'm proud that I can honestly say that with DADA we are doing something that impacts the lives of people in wonderful ways, and that we have created a work of art that involves a global community of artists. I believe art is a human instinct, a human need, and essential to human progress and civilization. Society does not consider it a priority, but art should be an integral part of people's daily lives. Everybody should make art, and everybody should be able to collect art.Technology, and blockchain in particular, offers revolutionary ways by which this can happen. What excites me is precisely that blockchain allows us to broaden our usual mindset and explore ways to be more collaborative and more fair, and find unorthodox but effective solutions for artists.</p>
							<p><b>Which artworks, artists and styles do you admire the most, and which shaped you the most?</b><br>
							I grew up in a house where art was appreciated. My parents took us to museums from an early age and they were modest art collectors. My dad was an advisor to collectors. So even though I'm not an artist, I have been around art for as long as I can remember. I like lots of art, from the Renaissance to mostly modern art. I love too many artists to count here. I don't like the artists-marketers like Banksy or Jeff Koons.</p>
