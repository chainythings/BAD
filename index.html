					<p>We came across this lovely thing and are happy to share it with you!<br><br>Today: Drone Graffiti. A combination of street art and blockchain - two of our absolute favorite topics. What a blast! People of the Drone Graffiti Project set themselves two goals: One is to fight ephemerality of urban artworks by storing them in a public distributed ledger. Second is to install collaborative artworks by help of drones and backed by blockchain technology on public spaces. Wow! <a href="https://www.dronegraffiti.com/" target="_blank">GO!</a></p>

						like picasso, or if you'd love to see your podcast, marketplace or protocol listed on B.A.D - don't hestitate
						and drop us a line via twitter or e-mail. <span class="tagged">We'll provide you with a link to our nice submission form and are

				<h2>B.A.D WHAT AND HOW</h2>
				<ul class="posts">
					<li>
						<h4>B.A.D - What's that?</h4>
						With B.A.D, we introduce a mainly edited, partly community fed web directory that serves as a service featuring a comprehensive collection of current, future and former projects which are dedicated to blockchain art, crypto collectibles and Non Fungible Tokens. B.A.D covers visual, auditive and multimedia blockchain art and is open to contents from individuals and institutions active in the field. Information about events, art works, technological developments and further information will contribute to an overview on a wide range of activities related to this ever emerging topic. By providing educational resources related to blockchain, dApps and tools, we help to onboard artists and collectors, and hope not only to empower them, but also to contribute to the mass adoption of blockchainart, cryptocollectibles, blockchaintechnology and crypto currencies. <a href="about.html">Read more.</a>
				    </li>
					<li>
						<h4>Big fail, 'cause you are centralized!</h4>
Well, kind of. Sure, B.A.D is compiled from info collected with help of almighty google's data universe. Right. But: B.A.D is as transparent as possible: First, people who submitted contents have access to their data via the url which they received after the form was submitted; if not (which is the case when B.A.D members submit data), we're happy to provide representatives of the submitted item access. Second, we have a sexy public API. So everybody who is interested in the submitted data can access them via <a href="https://blockchainart.directory/api?id=1rtOzAz1hvxZNionO3nZ2XPAGReS441ASJ401hdKMo3M&amp;sheet=1&amp;integers=false&amp;rows=false" target="_blank">this</a> link. Have centralized, but transparent fun everybody.</li>
