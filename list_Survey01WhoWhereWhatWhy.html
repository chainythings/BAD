							</header>
								<h3>Who, where, what and why #blockchainart, #cryptocollectibles and #nft?</h3>

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Following up a discussion on the RAREAF2 telegram channels, we initiated a survey addressing blockchainart and cryptocollectibles artists, collectors, gallery owners and programmers, and asked them: Why are you active in the field? Which platforms do you use? How are you producing your artworks? How much profit do you make? And we wanted to learn about their ideas on NFT, education and value. We received 29 answers by May 11th, and want to thank all contributors!<br><br>
							As most questions required text answers, we'll need some more time to to write all this up. As for the moment, we provide all answers unfiltered, because we think this is also in the raw version useful for further discussions regarding blockchainart related topics and contributes to the further development in the field. So: this for now; more to come.<br><br>
